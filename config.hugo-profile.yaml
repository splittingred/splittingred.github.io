    content: |-
      I love building things.
      
      I'm currently a Principal Engineer at BigCommerce in Austin, and a former Sr Architect for MODX.
      
      I've built and led teams to build high-scaling, dynamic services and systems in many various languages and technologies, including Ruby, PHP, Golang, and JavaScript, with further experience in Rails, gRPC, Envoy, MySQL, Consul, Google Cloud, SCSS/SASS, RabbitMQ, 0mq, linkerd, Scala, Docker, Nomad, Sencha, Angular, ExtJS, ColdFusion, terraform, kubernetes, and others. I'm familiar with designing and directing microservices, hexagonal architectures, authorization systems, development environments, open source libraries, and asynchronous event-driven systems.
      
      I believe in the power of team over individuals, and how processes and practices can shape that at companies. I value transparency and collaboration, and think the most successful teams are built on trust and accountability. I believe iterative progress beats idealistic arguments every time.
      
      I love to code with quality, build neat tech, and generally just get stuff done.
